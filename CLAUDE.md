# Cross-Chain Bridge Development Guide

## Project Overview

Building an enterprise-grade cross-chain bridge connecting EVM (Ethereum, Polygon) and eventually Non-EVM blockchains with KMS integration for security.

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation (Day 1-3)

- [x] Create project directory structure
- [x] Initialize Foundry for smart contract development
- [x] Set up TypeScript project for relayer
- [x] Configure ESLint and Prettier

### Phase 2: Smart Contract Development (Day 4-7)

- [x] Create Bridge contract with lock mechanism
- [x] Create Wrapped Token contract with mint/burn
- [ ] Implement validator signature verification
- [ ] Add nonce management for replay protection
- [ ] Write bridge contract events

### Phase 3: Local Testing Environment (Day 8-9)

- [ ] Set up Ganache for local Ethereum
- [ ] Set up Ganache for local Polygon
- [ ] Create deployment scripts
- [ ] Deploy contracts to local networks

### Phase 4: Smart Contract Testing (Day 10-12)

- [ ] Write unit tests for lock/unlock
- [ ] Write unit tests for mint/burn
- [ ] Write integration tests for bridge flow

### Phase 5: Relayer Service Development (Day 13-17)

- [ ] Create relayer project structure
- [ ] Implement event listener for both chains
- [ ] Build transaction builder and signer
- [ ] Add queue system for pending transactions
- [ ] Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Add database for transaction history

### Phase 6: Security & Key Management (Day 18-20)

- [ ] Set up AWS KMS or HashiCorp Vault
- [ ] Implement key rotation mechanism
- [ ] Add multi-sig wallet support

### Phase 7: Frontend Development (Day 21-24)

- [ ] Create React app with Web3 setup
- [ ] Build wallet connection component
- [ ] Create bridge transfer form
- [ ] Implement transaction status tracker
- [ ] Add transaction history view

### Phase 8: Monitoring & Observability (Day 25-26)

- [ ] Set up Prometheus metrics
- [ ] Configure Grafana dashboards
- [ ] Implement structured logging with Winston
- [ ] Add alert system for failures

### Phase 9: Testing & Optimization (Day 27-28)

- [ ] Write end-to-end test suite
- [ ] Perform gas optimization
- [ ] Conduct security audit

### Phase 10: Deployment & Documentation (Day 29-30)

- [ ] Create Docker images
- [ ] Write docker-compose configuration
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Deploy to testnet
- [ ] Write comprehensive documentation

## Commands & Scripts

### Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Start local blockchain
npm run chain:local

# Deploy contracts
npm run deploy:local

# Start relayer
npm run relayer:dev
```

### Docker

```bash
# Build all services
docker-compose build

# Start all services
docker-compose up

# Stop all services
docker-compose down
```

## Architecture Notes

### Bridge Flow

1. User locks tokens on source chain
2. Bridge contract emits event
3. Relayer detects event
4. Relayer validates and signs transaction
5. Relayer submits to destination chain
6. Destination chain mints/unlocks tokens

### Security Considerations

- Multi-signature validation
- Nonce-based replay protection
- KMS for key management
- Rate limiting
- Emergency pause mechanism

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Gas optimization complete
- [ ] Security audit complete
- [ ] Testnet deployment successful
